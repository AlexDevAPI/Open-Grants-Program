## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 



API Protocol is a new generation of decentralized web API connector protocol for Web 3.0 applications, designed to make web 3.0 APIs easier to find, access and use, thus promoting the development of Web 3.0.
 
API Protocol is a next-generation decentralized API (dAPI) service aggregator that enables your applications (dApps) to be truly decentralized and helps you accelerate development, significantly reduce time-to-market, reduce the risks associated with scaling and security over technology, significantly reduce downtime, and run applications on any decentralized or centralized cloud as well as any blockchain and smart contract platform.
   
 The API Protocol platform brings together a number of core technology innovations that will enable developers to build truly decentralized blockchain applications and digital products in the fastest way possible, without compromising on scalability, performance, security, resiliency and decentralization.
   
 API Protocol will build a cross-chain decentralized API service management platform on Polkdot based on the Substrate framework to provide decentralized API infrastructure for blockchain developers and improve the efficiency of developers building Dapp.

## Team Interest

 The initial team members of API Protocol come from the blockchain and basic software operation and maintenance industries, and have a deep understanding of the operation and developer pain points in the IT industry. In order to serve the Web 3.0 ecosystem and make the Web 3.0 APIs easier to use, discover and find, so that developers can assemble their business like building blocks, we launched the API Protocol project.

  ##### 3 API Adaptation Layer
  
   Adapt the underlying API services to help developers unify and shield the underlying service implementation details, and developers can enjoy out-of-the-box services.
   
  ##### 4 API Service Availability Engine
  
  Defines service availability metrics and compensation schemes for API services.

  ##### 5 API Service Registration
  
  Developers register API services so that other developers can discover and invoke them.
  
  ##### 6 API service discovery mechanism 
  
  The process of discovering the service provider during the invocation.
  
 ##### 7 API MarketPlace
  
   Economic mechanism to provide suitable API services to openers
   
## Project usage scenarios:

  ##### 1 Blockchain as a service 
  
  ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIProtocol/research/main/block%20chain%20%20as%20a%20service.png)
  
  BlockChain as a service makes it easy for developers to complete instant access to Ethereum, Filecoin/IPFS, Polkadot, Nucypher, Uniswap and other on-chain and off-chain protocols.
  
  ##### 2 API as a service
  
  ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIProtocol/research/main/api%20as%20a%20service.png)
  
  API as a service, allowing developers to easily switch and access between various underlying protocols.
  
  ##### 3 Decentralized API Market
  
  ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIProtocol/research/main/marketplace.png)
  
  A decentralized API marketplace based on Substrate blockchain technology, giving developers more and more reliable service options.
  
  ##### 4 SDK as a service
  
  ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIProtocol/research/main/sdk%20as%20a%20service.png)
  
   The decentralized SDK developed by the API Protocol team allows developers to quickly build their own applications
   
  ## Substrate / Polkadot Integration:
  
  The API Protocol will be developed and designed based on the Substate 2.0 underlying engine, leveraging the Substate 2.0 off-chain module to provide API services for Web 3.0 developers.
  
  ## Ecosystem Fit 
  API Protocol is the Web 3.0 API Economy infrastructure, dedicated to making Web 3.0 APIs easier to find, access and use, to develop Web 3.0 applications more simple and efficient, thus promoting the development of Web 3.0.

## Team's experience
The project leader, Haijun, is a serial entrepreneur who has experienced the entrepreneurial wave of mobile Internet and enterprise-level IT services, and has also participated in the public chain development of blockchain projects. Previously, he developed products based on the Cosmos-SDK ecosystem, but he saw polkadot’s The Web 3.0 ecological vision is more in line with the development trend of the Internet, and I hope to participate in the construction of the Web 3.0 ecology, so the API Protocol project was established.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):** 3
* **Total Costs:** 1.5 BTC

#### Milestone 1 — Verify Production of Concepts (POC) and Implement Substrate Modules

In this milestone, we will verify features with limited users and launch the testnet for the production of concepts. The implementation of off-chain workers of Substrate Framework will be built and validated.

* **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
* **Full-time Equivalent (FTE)**: 3
* **Costs:** 1.5 BTC

### Community Engagement

API Protocol 's current community engagement strategies include:

* **Exposure on Leading Media Channels:** We will continue to publish articles about API Protocol in well-known media such as Golden Finance and Mars Finance.
* **Ecosystem Development Lead Program:** As the team is still small, we are now recruiting excellent developers through various channels, and later we will also set up a community eco-developer fund to attract more developers to participate in the API Protocol eco-building.
* **Promotion of Online and Offline Events:** We are also actively participating in Polkadot ecological AMA activities, in order to better understand Polkadot, so as to better serve Web 3.0 developers.

API Protocol's future community engagement strategies include:

* **Bounty Program for General Community:** API Protocol is a brand new project, the community is relatively weak, so in the initial stage, we are more to find like-minded community ambassadors to help build the API community. For these community ambassadors, we will also give generous returns。

* **Incentive Program for API Providers:** After the main functions are completed, we will set up an incentive program to encourage more market API  providers for API Protocol。


## Future Plans

* Expand the team
* Expand community influence.
* Ecological construction.
