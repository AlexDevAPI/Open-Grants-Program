## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 



API Protocol is a new generation of decentralized web API connector protocol for Web 3.0 applications, designed to make web 3.0 APIs easier to find, access and use, thus promoting the development of Web 3.0.
 
API Protocol is a next-generation decentralized API (dAPI) service aggregator that enables your applications (dApps) to be truly decentralized and helps you accelerate development, significantly reduce time-to-market, reduce the risks associated with scaling and security over technology, significantly reduce downtime, and run applications on any decentralized or centralized cloud as well as any blockchain and smart contract platform.
   
 The API Protocol platform brings together a number of core technology innovations that will enable developers to build truly decentralized blockchain applications and digital products in the fastest way possible, without compromising on scalability, performance, security, resiliency and decentralization.
   
 API Protocol will build a cross-chain decentralized API service management platform on Polkdot based on the Substrate framework to provide decentralized API infrastructure for blockchain developers and improve the efficiency of developers building Dapp.

## Team Interest

 The initial team members of API Protocol come from the blockchain and basic software operation and maintenance industries, and have a deep understanding of the operation and developer pain points in the IT industry. In order to serve the Web 3.0 ecosystem and make the Web 3.0 APIs easier to use, discover and find, so that developers can assemble their business like building blocks, we launched the API Protocol project.
 
 ## Project Details 
 
 
### Architecture

#### Technical components:
  ##### 1 Consensus Layer 
  
   Maintain the consensus security of the entire network security, API Protocol underlying the development of the Substrate framework, can enjoy the security and efficiency of Substrate.
   
  ##### 2 P2P Network 
  
   Defines how ecological nodes interact and find each other
   
  ##### 3 API Adaptation Layer
  
   Adapt the underlying API services to help developers unify and shield the underlying service implementation details, and developers can enjoy out-of-the-box services.
   
  ##### 4 API Service Availability Engine
  
  Defines service availability metrics and compensation schemes for API services.

  ##### 5 API Service Registration
  
  Developers register API services so that other developers can discover and invoke them.
  
  ##### 6 API service discovery mechanism 
  
  The process of discovering the service provider during the invocation.
  
 ##### 7 API MarketPlace
  
   Economic mechanism to provide suitable API services to openers
